# Flight Booker

## Quick Take

[The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/flight-booker) Flight Booker app highlights some more advanced uses of forms in Rails. This project creates the initial steps to booking a one-way flight. 

## How it Works

Users can search available flights with a form of dropdown menus covering departing airport, arriving airport, date and number of passengers. Next users can choose from the resulting flights with another form or refine their results with a new search. Finally users can enter all the passenger information and see the resulting booking.
